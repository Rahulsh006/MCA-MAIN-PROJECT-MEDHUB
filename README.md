# Multiple Disease Prediction Webapp

> **Abstract** : The designed web app employs the Streamlit Python library for frontend design and communicates with backend ML models to predict the probability of diseases. Multiple Disease Prediction has many machine learning and Deep learning models used in Detecton of Diseases. It is designed to choose the diseases from the navigation bar or a sidebar for which we want to make a prediction using various input values. These input values will be the symptoms, physical health data, X-rays, MRA scans or blood test results. Model is trained from historic data, so it can make accurate predictions. It's capable of predicting whether someone has Heart issues, Liver conditions, Chronic Kidney, Brain tumor, Glaucoma, Pneumonia and more based on the provided symptoms, medical history, and results.
Framework: Streamlit-Python
